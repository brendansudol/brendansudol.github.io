This week at work, I gave a tech talk on atomic/functional CSS and why I love
it.

**tl;dr** It's a design system of tiny, modular, single-purpose, immutable
presentational classes, which can be combined to create a highly flexible and
expressive array of new UI components without adding to or even touching a
stylesheet. It's a simple, fast, and fun way to build websites.
