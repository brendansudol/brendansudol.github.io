A little while ago, Mike Bostock, creator of [D3][d3], wrote up an [awesome
tutorial][tutorial] on how to make a map using D3 and [TopoJSON][topojson]. It
goes through where to find geo data, the tools you need to manipulate and
convert the data, and then how to display and style the data in the browser.
It's a great resource if you're interested in geographical visualizations.

In the tutorial, Mike makes a simple map of the United Kingdom and its four
constituent counties. I thought it'd be fun and good practice to apply the same
techniques to make a map of a different place. I landed on my home, New York
City. The final product is below (and the [code][code] is here):
