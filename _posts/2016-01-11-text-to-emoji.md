Sadly, I've been known to type actual words when there's a perfectly good emoji
that could and should be used instead. How embarrassing, I know.

To help with this, I made a little site where you can type or paste in text and
it will translate to emojis wherever possible.

![English to Emoji](/assets/img/writing/emojist.png){: .my3.border }

It's made with React and [this](https://github.com/muan/emojilib) awesome Emoji
dictionary. The source code is
