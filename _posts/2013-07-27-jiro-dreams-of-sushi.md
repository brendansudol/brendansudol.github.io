Just watched this documentary on Netflix. What a beautiful and powerful film.
The documentary "follows Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi master and owner of
Sukiyabashi Jiro, a Michelin three-star restaurant, on his continuing quest to
perfect the art of sushi."

It's incredibly inspiring. This guy has spent the better part of a century
making sushi. He loves what he does. And he's better at it than anyone in the
world. How did he get there? By immersing himself in this craft and working hard
every single day to refine and improve his skills.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I'll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is.

I'm so impressed by Jiro's work ethic, dedication, focus, and attention to
detail. And the high standards he holds himself to, as well as everyone he works
with. For example, here's the philosophy of his tuna dealer:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I either buy my first choice, or I buy nothing. If ten tuna are for sale, only one can be the best. I buy that one.

Man, love that attitude. The film's soundtrack, filled with several [Philip
Glass][glass] compositions, is also, fittingly, exceptional.

Alright, time for me to get back to work on improving my own skills.
