I just found out about this cool Javascript library for creating SVG patterns
called [Texture.js][texture] that's built on top of D3 and designed for
visualizations. I wanted to give it a spin, so here's a quick map of the
continents with a few of these nifty textures (in UVA colors as a show of
support during March Madness). Code is [here][code].
