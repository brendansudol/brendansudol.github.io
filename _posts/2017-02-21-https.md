My website (the one you’re reading) now supports HTTPS(ish)!
HTTP<span class='h6'>i</span>S<span class='h6'>h</span>™ for short.

GitHub Pages (which hosts this site) doesn't ordinarily support SSL on custom
domains (yet), but you can add it using Cloudflare's
[Universal SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/).

And it's free and really easy to do, both things I didn't realize (and
mistakenly led to my tardiness here). Here are a couple good walkthroughs to set
it up
([1](https://www.goyllo.com/github/pages/free-cloudflare-ssl-for-custom-domain/),
[2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)).

I know this isn't the perfect solution -- while the connection between the user
and Cloudflare is now encrypted, the Cloudflare ↔ GitHub connection is not (more

-- but at least it’s better than a sharp stick in the eye.
