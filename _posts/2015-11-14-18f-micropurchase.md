Last week, 18F completed their first experiment to contract for open-source
contributions
([announcement](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/),
[details](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/26/micro-purchase-criteria-announcement/),
[lessons](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/06/micro-purchase-lessons/)). They picked
out a piece of work on the product roadmap for their
[CALC tool](https://calc.gsa.gov/), and ran a "reverse auction" to determine the
winning bid. The bidding started at $3,499 and lasted for 3 days. With two hours
to go, the price was down to $499. I then made the minimum bid of $1 and won the
contract.

A bunch of people seemed to get upset about this. The story made the
[front page](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10471677) of Hacker News, some
thought I was trying to "game the system" or "troll the bid system", others
thought it wasn't "ethical" or "legal", and many thought I would never complete
the work.

I was suprised by this reaction. It didn't seem controversial to me. Writing
some code to help out the government and the general publicâ€”what a unique
opportunity! And from the trend of bids, it looked like the price was heading to
a low number. Who knows, perhaps it would have even gone negative if that was
possible, as in people paying their own money to participate.

In any case, several people have asked me why I bid $1. So here goes:

Simply put, it's because I wanted to work on the project, and knew the minimum
bid would guarantee me of that. Now why did I want to work on the project? A lot
of reasons!

1. I love what 18F, the U.S. Digital Service, and co. are doing to revamp
   government services, and I thought it'd be fun to get involved and contribute
   to the civic cause.

2. I use open source technologies on a daily basis, and this seemed like a great
   opportunity to give back a little.

3. I love working on little web [projects](/projects) in my free time. This is
   $1 more than I make on those, and this one actually helps people.

4. I figured it would be cool to be a part of this first micro-purchase
   experiment, and demonstrate that there are people (at least 1 but I think a
   lot more) willing and excited to help out on meaningful, civic-minded
   initiatives.

5. 18F did a great job of defining a clear and contained problem that I knew I
   could accomplish over a couple days in my spare time.

I'd like to give a shout-out to my friend and partner in crime for this project,
[Andy Chosak](https://github.com/chosak). We split up the various tasks and then
polished and checked everything together.

Overall, I thought it was a great experience and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
Now I need to figure out what to do with my princely spoils :)
