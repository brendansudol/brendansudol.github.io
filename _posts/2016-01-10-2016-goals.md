Like a lot of people, I try to set some goals / resolutions at the beginning of
the year. I've never shared my list before, but I'm curious to see if the added
transparency gives me a boost of accountability and increases my resolve to
accomplish everything. So here goes:

### Tech stuff

* Learn Swift, develop 2+ iPhone apps, and launch them to App Store (React
  Native might work too)

* Give [Uncoverly](http://www.uncoverly.com) some TLC and open source code

* Build MVPs for two ideas I've been kicking around for a while (one relates to
  behavioral economics & commitment contracts and the other is a fun gift
  subscription box for kids)

* Make something cool that has a significant machine learning component (maybe
  an application using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or something
  predictive around commerce or sports)

### Personal / Family

* Keep up my blog writing (1+ post per month)

* Read more books (1+ book per month)

* Become a better cook and cook more!

* Travel more with Libby

* Call and visit family & friends more

### Fitness / Sports

* Run 3 half marathons and get faster each time (reach goal of 1:35)

* Get golf handicap under 8 (currently around 9)

* Play in a soccer league (reach goal: score a goal!)
