I'm happy to announce my latest side project, [DC Food Trucks Today][dcftt].

It's a real-time map of all the scrumptious food trucks in the DC area.
Locations are determined by analyzing recent tweets of food truck Twitter
accounts.

I was inspired to make this because:

* Food trucks are sooo good, and I wanted a very simple way to see what was
  around me so I could plan for and get excited about my upcoming lunches.
* It seems like the current way to do this is to use [foodtruckfiesta.com][fff],
  which I found to be a bit frustrating to navigate (for example, I think the
  map is too small and difficult to decipher).
* I recently discovered [Mapbox][mapbox] during a [hackathon][hackathon], loved
  it, and wanted to dig in a bit more with their API.

If you're a food truck owner, you can log in with your Twitter account to
further customize your locations throughout the day:

There's still a few more things I'd like to add (for example, allowing users to
add trucks / locations that are missing, search functionality, the ability for
truck owners to offer discounts), but for now, it's a start. If you're in the DC
area and hungry, give it a shot and let me know what you think.
