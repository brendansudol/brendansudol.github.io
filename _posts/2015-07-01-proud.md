I'm a little late to the party, but in honor of the Supreme Court marriage
equality ruling last week, I wanted to make a commemorative visualization:

<div id="viz-states-united">
</div>

<!-- this is here so i can easily re-use this shadow effect in the viz above -->
<svg width="0" height="0">
  <defs>
    <filter id="viz-shadow" height="130%">
      <feGaussianBlur in="SourceAlpha" stdDeviation="3"/> 
      <feOffset dx="2" dy="2" result="offsetblur"/>
      <feComponentTransfer>
        <feFuncA type="linear" slope="0.2"/>
      </feComponentTransfer>
      <feMerge> 
        <feMergeNode/>
        <feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/> 
      </feMerge>
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>

I created it with D3.js (code is [here][code]), and the idea was inspired by
[this][listing] awesome letterpress print from Etsy (discovered via
[Uncoverly][uncoverly]). All states are rendered to scale, and you can hover
over them to see which states are which.

Couldn't agree more with Obama here: "We can say in no uncertain terms that
weâ€™ve made our union a little more perfect...America should be very proud." And
if you haven't read [Justice Kennedy's closing paragraph][kennedy] in the
majority ruling, it is quite lovely.
