One of the things I love about working at a startup is the breadth of things I
work on and the diversity of skills I learn on a daily basis. Recently, our team
was kicking around a few different ideas and building some very basic websites
to try and validate some of our assumptions. I tried my hand at sprucing up the
logos â€” **Seasonal** was a fresh & local food related idea, and **Antalytics**
was a data related service:

![seasonal](/assets/img/writing/logo-seasonal.png){: .block.mb2.border.sm-col-7 }
![antalytics](/assets/img/writing/logo-antalytics.png){: .block.border.sm-col-7 }

As you can see, I'm definitely not a designer by any stretch of the imagination,
but it was fun firing up [Sketch][sketch] (which is awesome btw) and pretending
for the afternoon :)
