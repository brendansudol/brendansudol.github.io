Greetings, world (or the 7 people who end up seeing this). I'm Brendan and I'm
excited to be here. After a couple false starts, I'm going to try again to get
serious about blogging.

I know blogs need to be watered frequently and get proper sunlight to flourish,
and I'm going to try hard to give this the TLC it deserves. And I feel like
there are a lot of cool stuff happening in my life these days which will give me
some good material. For one, I recently started working on the data/analytics
team at [Etsy][etsy], an online marketplace for unique things, and I'm
absolutely loving it. I'm also continuing to learn and get better at programming
-- ruby (and rails) and, more recently, javascript and [d3.js][d3.js], are the
languages and frameworks I've been spending the most time with. And on top of
that, I live in NYC and I'm lucky enough to see and do some awesome stuff in the
city.

A few other facts about me which will surely permeate into future posts:

* I'm an avid golfer. I love the game and try to play as often as I can. I also
  enjoy playing tennis and basketball, and I'm now getting really into ping
  pong. I may or may not have actually taken an hour-long ping pong lesson last
  weekend :)
* I get inappropriately excited about cool data visualizations, like [this][d1],
  [this][d2], and [this][d3], and love applying similar techniques to Etsy data.
* I'm from Virginia and went to UVA for college, and miss the southern
  hospitality that was so common down there. Is it me, or is niceness suspicious
  in NYC?
* I studied math and economics in college and came out of school doing
  consulting. It was a good experience and I'm sure I'll write about it
  sometime, but I couldn't be happier switching gears to the tech sector. It's
  so different, and so much better, and I can't see myself ever leaving this
  space.

Another reason why I'm excited about this new blog is the software I'm using to
power it. It's called [Jekyll][jekyll], a "simple, blog aware, static site
generator" built by Github cofounder, Tom Preston-Werner. It's incredibly
flexible and customizable -- I have complete control over the structure and
style, so get excited for constant tinkering. And I can write my posts in
Markdown with my favorite text editor, and it converts it automatically into
pretty HTML, with everything backed up on Github. If you're interested in
learning more about Jekyll, check out Tom's [blog post about it][tom], or take a
look at other [sites][sites] that use it.

Can't wait to write and share more soon.
