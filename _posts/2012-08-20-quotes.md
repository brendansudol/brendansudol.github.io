I'm a sucker for great quotes. I love them. I love quotes by famous people,
quotes from movies, quotes on success or leadership or creativity or any other
topic for that matter. I love scouring through them, finding the gems,
memorizing them, and then pondering them often and repeating them in convos if
there's a shred of relevance. There's something really magical about a great
quote -- one that can distill a powerful idea to its essence, or impart wisdom
in a mere sentence, or provide that beautiful, succinct articulation of
everything you believe in or are striving for.

I think I'm going to start a separate section on this site where I'll compile
all my favorite quotes and new ones as I find them.

Here's a random sample of some of my favs off the top of my head tonight:

<blockquote>
