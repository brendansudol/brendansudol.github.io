* I [read 28 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/52018258),
  which is a new PR, and well above my 20 book goal for the year. I want to keep
  this pace up.
* I [ran 310 miles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/7175427) across 118 runs.
  This isn't great but not horrible considering I was basically at zero going
  into June. My goal for 2018 is 500 miles.
* I [watched 57 movies](https://letterboxd.com/brendino/films/diary/).
  Highlights: **Get Out**, **The Big Sick**. This is the first time I've tracked
  this. No goals for 2018 but I hope to go on many more cinematic adventures.
* I [shipped code on 290 days](https://github.com/brendansudol), or ~80% of
  days. Not a super useful metric, though I do believe quantity is a leading
  indicator of quality.
* I spoke at 2 conferences: [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/) and
  [PyGotham](https://2017.pygotham.org/) (slide decks are [here](/decks)). This
  was very much out of my comfort zone but I think they went alright and it was
  great public speaking practice.
