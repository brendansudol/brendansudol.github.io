I just read
[Golfing Wit](https://www.amazon.com/Golfing-Wit-Quips-Quotes-Golf-Obsessed/dp/1849536627),
a tiny, little book of quips and quotes I found when visiting my parent’s house
last week.

Many of the observations weren’t the best, tending toward banality or sexism,
but there were a few sharp and glittering gems.

Here are ten I liked:

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of tees in your bag is always less than 3 or more than 600.</p>
  <footer>– Michael Ryan</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Winning isn't about making a lot of great shots. It's about making very few bad ones.</p>
  <footer>– Tommy Armour</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My most notable trait is snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory.</p>
  <footer>– Doug Saunders</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Golf tips are like aspirin. One may do you good but if you swallow the whole bottle you'll be lucky to survive.</p>
  <footer>– Harvey Pennick</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser.</p>
  <footer>– Gary Player</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of us believe that our good shots are the norm, and our bad ones aberrations.</p>
  <footer>– Alec Morrison</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Golf is my profession. Show business is just to pay the green fees.</p>
  <footer>– Bob Hope</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it any accident that 'God' comes just before 'golf' in the dictionary?</p>
  <footer>– Dave Allen</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My career started slowly, then tapered off.</p>
  <footer>– Gary McCord</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only thing I ever learned from losing was that I don't like it.</p>
  <footer>– Tom Watson</footer>
</blockquote>
