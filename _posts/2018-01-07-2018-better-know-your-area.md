I'm happy to reveal a little side project I've been working on recently,
[Better Know Your Area](http://betterknowyourarea.com).

Better Know Your Area (BKYA) provides an at-a-glance view of social, economic,
demographic, and housing characteristics for counties across the United States.
All numbers are presented alongside state and national statistics for context.
The data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (2016
5-year estimates).

The U.S. Census Bureau has a massive amount of data about the American people
across a variety of topics and geographical levels. This data is incredible but
it can also be overwhelming to navigate and challenging to put in the proper
context.

My goal with BKYA is to make it easier for people to learn about places they
care about and highlight some super interesting, publically available data so
they can explore further.

The name of the site was inspired by the hilarious recurring segment _Better
Know a District_ from
[The Colbert Report](http://www.cc.com/shows/the-colbert-report).
