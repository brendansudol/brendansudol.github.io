Election Day is fast approaching. Do you think you can pull off a Nate Silver
and correctly predict every state? Prove it :)

I made a little site where you can play around with different scenarios and
create your own election forecast.

<div class="py2">

    <img class="p1 border-box border" src="/assets/img/writing/prez-pickem.png" width="500">
  </a>
</div>

Give it a shot and may the odds be ever in your favor! ðŸ˜€ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
