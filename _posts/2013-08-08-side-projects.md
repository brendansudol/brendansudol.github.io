Added a 'projects' page (link in the header â†‘) to organize some of the silly,
half-baked ideas that I work on from time to time. Nothing super exciting in
there, YET. But it's been fun diving in to various APIs, learning more about
various parts of the web stack, and thinking through the design elements and
user experiences.
