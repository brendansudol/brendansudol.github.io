I’m Brendan and I’m excited to be here. After a couple false starts, I’m going to try again to get serious about blogging.</p> <p>I know blogs need to be watered frequently and get proper sunlight to flourish, and I’m going to try hard to give this the TLC it deserves. And I feel like there are a lot of cool stuff happening in my life these days which will give me some good material. For one, I recently started working on the data/analytics team at <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, an online marketplace for unique things, and I’m absolutely loving it. I’m also continuing to learn and get better at programming – ruby (and rails) and, more recently, javascript and <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, are the languages and frameworks I’ve been spending the most time with. And on top of that, I live in NYC and I’m lucky enough to see and do some awesome stuff in the city.</p> <p>A few other facts about me which will surely permeate into future posts:</p> <ul> <li>I’m an avid golfer. I love the game and try to play as often as I can. I also enjoy playing tennis and basketball, and I’m now getting really into ping pong. I may or may not have actually taken an hour-long ping pong lesson last weekend :)</li> <li>I get inappropriately excited about cool data visualizations, like <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/uberdata/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html">this</a>, and <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/">this</a>, and love applying similar techniques to Etsy data.</li> <li>I’m from Virginia and went to UVA for college, and miss the southern hospitality that was so common down there. Is it me, or is niceness suspicious in NYC?</li> <li>I studied math and economics in college and came out of school doing consulting. It was a good experience and I’m sure I’ll write about it sometime, but I couldn’t be happier switching gears to the tech sector. It’s so different, and so much better, and I can’t see myself ever leaving this space.</li> </ul> <p>Another reason why I’m excited about this new blog is the software I’m using to power it. It’s called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a “simple, blog aware, static site generator” built by Github cofounder, Tom Preston-Werner. It’s incredibly flexible and customizable – I have complete control over the structure and style, so get excited for constant tinkering. And I can write my posts in Markdown with my favorite text editor, and it converts it automatically into pretty HTML, with everything backed up on Github.
