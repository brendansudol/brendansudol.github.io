Equipped with a deep learning <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">model</a> open sourced by a Stanford researcher (with an <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">amazing accompanying article</a>), I tried to find out.</p> <p>To start, I compiled every <a href="http://teamcoco.com/jokes">Conan O’Brien monologue joke</a> over the last ~5 years (results <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendansudol/rnn-joke-generate/master/data/conan/input.txt">here</a>). These jokes served as the input for a recurrent neural network (RNN) character-level language model. The model learns the patterns and style of the text and is then able to generate new text, one character a time, that is similar in style but still unique (code and additional details on <a href="https://github.com/brendansudol/rnn-joke-generate">GitHub</a>).</p> <p>Some of the better results are below. A few of the set-ups are hilariously fresh and I love the attempted quotations. All in all, they’re not exactly ha-ha funny, but definitely quite amusing. At least for now, comedy writers’ jobs are safe :)</p> <blockquote> <p>A new study says that a second wife is coming out with a new song “Seattle Starbucks.” The study was conducted by the presidential candidates and said, “That’s not the most popular story.”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Donald Trump has been invited to have sex with the check of single of her wife.
