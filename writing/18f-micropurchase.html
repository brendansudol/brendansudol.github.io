One dollar. </p> <footer><cite>My take on that scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U" target="_blank">The Social Network</a></cite></footer> </blockquote> <p>Last week, 18F completed their first experiment to contract for open-source contributions (<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/">announcement</a>, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/26/micro-purchase-criteria-announcement/">details</a>, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/06/micro-purchase-lessons/">lessons</a>). They picked out a piece of work on the product roadmap for their <a href="https://calc.gsa.gov/">CALC tool</a>, and ran a “reverse auction” to determine the winning bid. The bidding started at $3,499 and lasted for 3 days. With two hours to go, the price was down to $499. I then made the minimum bid of $1 and won the contract.</p> <p>A bunch of people seemed to get upset about this. The story made the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10471677">front page</a> of Hacker News, some thought I was trying to “game the system” or “troll the bid system”, others thought it wasn’t “ethical” or “legal”, and many thought I would never complete the work.</p> <p>I was suprised by this reaction. It didn’t seem controversial to me. Writing some code to help out the government and the general public—what a unique opportunity! And from the trend of bids, it looked like the price was heading to a low number. Who knows, perhaps it would have even gone negative if that was possible, as in people paying their own money to participate.</p> <p>In any case, several people have asked me why I bid $1. So here goes:</p> <p>Simply put, it’s because I wanted to work on the project, and knew the minimum bid would guarantee me of that. Now why did I want to work on the project? A lot of reasons!</p> <ol> <li> <p>I love what 18F, the U.S. Digital Service, and co. are doing to revamp government services, and I thought it’d be fun to get involved and contribute to the civic cause.</p> </li> <li> <p>I use open source technologies on a daily basis, and this seemed like a great opportunity to give back a little.</p> </li> <li> <p>I love working on little web <a href="/projects">projects</a> in my free time. This is $1 more than I make on those, and this one actually helps people.</p> </li> <li> <p>I figured it would be cool to be a part of this first micro-purchase experiment, and demonstrate that there are people (at least 1 but I think a lot more) willing and excited to help out on meaningful, civic-minded initiatives.</p> </li> <li> <p>18F did a great job of defining a clear and contained problem that I knew I could accomplish over a couple days in my spare time.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I’d like to give a shout-out to my friend and partner in crime for this project, <a href="https://github.com/chosak">Andy Chosak</a>. We split up the various tasks and then polished and checked everything together.</p> <p>Overall, I thought it was a great experience and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Now I need to figure out what to do with my princely spoils :)</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class='p1 center'> <img class='align-middle' src='/assets/img/misc/peace.gif' width='30'> </footer> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-37353161-5']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
