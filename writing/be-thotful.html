Mother’s Day, Grandpa’s Birthday, Nephew’s Preschool Graduation, you name it. And by the time I do remember, it’s way too late to get and send a nice gift. I’m often just scrambling to call and send my good wishes before people go to sleep :( It’s a bummer to the point of being ridiculous.</p> <p>I’ve tried calendars and post-it notes, but neither have worked very well. So I decided to make a little tool to help, and if you’re like me, you may find it useful as well: <a href="http://www.thotfully.com/">Thotfully.com</a></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/writing/thotfully.png" alt="thotfully" /></p> <p>Thotfully allows you to add in all those special occasions that sneak up on you, and it will send you text reminders leading up to the big day so you can buy a gift and plan accordingly. And if you know you’re going to be super busy, you can pick out one of the awesome gifts on the site in advance, and it will be ordered and delivered for you when it’s the right time. Free shipping and gift wrapping included :)</p> <p>I had a blast building the site and learned a ton in the process. I’m using <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, a nice and small and minimal Ruby web framework. I’m using the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> API for the text reminders and <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for the payment processing, and the site is hosted on Heroku. This was my first time integrating with Stripe and I was really impressed – their out-of-the-box Checkout form and flow is beautiful and their <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/v2">documentation is fantastic</a>. If you want to see the full source code for the site, check it out <a href="https://github.com/brendansudol/thotfully.com">here</a>.</p> <p>Another thing I learned from this project was how many decisions you have to make and the little things you have to do to put it all together and make it look half-way decent. Like messaging copy (thanks Linz!), font styles and sizes, color palettes, mobile responsiveness, form validations, data model associations, cookie expiration times, social sharing integration, page load performance, etc. I know I spent way too long on some of these things and should have completely punted on others, so this was a nice lesson for me in prioritizing what’s necessary and judiciously thinking about what’s crucial now vs. a nice feature for down the road.</p> <p>Always looking for feedback to make it better, so shout if you have any thoughts (thots?) and suggestions!</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class='p1 center'> <img class='align-middle' src='/assets/img/misc/peace.gif' width='30'> </footer> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-37353161-5']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
